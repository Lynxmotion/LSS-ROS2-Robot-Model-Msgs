# list of effectors to twist
string[] effectors

# how to apply coordinates to the effector
# lists what components of the effector frame or twist should be updated
# allowing a trajectory to only affect some parts of the target position
# or velocity such as X, XY, XYZ for translational and RPY for the
# rotational. Seperate translational and rotational components with a colon.
# The default value is an empty string, so all components are applied.
# ex:
#   "XY"       - only apply X and Y values of translational
#   "XY:Y"   - apply XY translational values, and Yaw rotation
#string components

# segment continuous twist trajectories
